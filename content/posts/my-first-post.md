So this is not my first blog post.

My original blog was better suited for a documentation/wiki website which is now hosted [here](https://github.com/ForeverAProgrammer/always-learning-wiki/wiki).

Originally I hosted my blog on Dreamhost which worked pretty well. Dreamhost made it really easy to setup WordPress but I got tired of paying to have the blog hosted there. So I moved the site to WordPress.com but found that while I could host the site for free I would have to pay a fee per month to modify the CSS.

So then I decided to move the site over to GitHub which allows me to host websites for free using GitHub pages. I decided to use Hugo to build the site because it's the fastest static site generator at there right now.

Most of these blog posts will be created in the evenings after I get off work so I maybe a little tired when I write them.
